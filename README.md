This is a dockerfile which can be used to build my fork of Clementine player for Windows

Although it's mostly for my personal use, everybody is welcome to try it out. I would appreciate any feedback.

## Usage
Clone this repo than cd in to the directory and run

docker build .

After a long while a file called Clementine-1.3.1.exe should appear. Dockerfile uses my own repos for both Clementine and it's dependencies.
